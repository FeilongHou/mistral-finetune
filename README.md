# Mistral LLM Fine-Tuning Project
Welcome to the Mistral LLM Fine-Tuning Project! This repository serves as a resource for the fine-tuning of the Mistral Language Model (LLM) for detecting toxic comment. Whether you're a student, researcher, or enthusiast in the field of artificial intelligence, this project aims to provide a comprehensive guide to fine-tuning Mistral LLM for your specific task.

## About Mistral LLM
Mistral LLM is a state-of-the-art language model developed by Mistral AI, based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. The pretrained model has been trained on a diverse range of text data and possesses a strong understanding of natural language semantics and syntax.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to enable users to fine-tune Mistral LLM for specific downstream tasks,  detecting toxic comment. By fine-tuning the model on task-specific data, users can leverage Mistral LLM's pre-trained knowledge to achieve better performance on their target tasks.

## Getting Started
To get started with fine-tuning Mistral LLM, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/mistral-llm-finetuning.git
  ```
2. Install Dependencies: Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed. You may use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Install dependencies using:
  ```
  pip install -q -U bitsandbytes
  pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
  pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/peft.git
  pip install -q -U git+https://github.com/huggingface/accelerate.git
  pip install -q -U datasets
  ```
3. Prepare Data: We used [AiresPucrs/toxic-comments](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AiresPucrs/toxic-comments)

4. Fine-Tune Mistral LLM: Utilize the provided scripts and notebooks to fine-tune Mistral LLM on your data. Experiment with different hyperparameters, training strategies, and model architectures to optimize performance for your task by running train_with_data.py.

5. Evaluate Performance: Evaluate the fine-tuned model on your task-specific evaluation metrics. Monitor metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, perplexity, etc., depending on the nature of your task by running inference_with_data.py.
